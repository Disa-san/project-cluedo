Cluedo - project

I enjoyed working on the Cluedo project, although a lot of the time, when writing JS, I still feel like I am just copying something without really understanding what I am doing or why I am doing it. But, I try to think that this is just part of the process. 

I was very much struggling with step 4 of the project. Basically when I started to work on the "object that holds the mystery", nothing worked anymore. I commented it out and realized that the code for revealing the mystery worked fine without it. This is something I don't really understand. I assume that I have done something wrong, but like Damien said earlier, if it is working the code is not wrong. So, I decided to leave it like that. 

Thank you for reviewing!
